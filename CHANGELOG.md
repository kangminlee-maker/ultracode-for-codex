# Changelog

All notable changes to `ultracode-for-codex` are recorded here. This file tracks
current-state release history; deeper design notes live under `docs/`.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and
the project uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.4] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- `setup` command (alias `doctor`): a single readiness preflight that reports
  the package version, Codex CLI presence and version, Codex app-server
  reachability, Codex authentication (ChatGPT login, API key, or a no-auth
  provider), and installed-skill freshness. Prints JSON by default (`--plain`
  for human lines) and exits non-zero when anything blocks a delegated phase, so
  a missing Codex install or a logged-out session is caught before a workflow
  starts instead of mid-run. The default skill preflight now calls it.
- `references/codex-agent-prompting.md`: model-current guidance for writing the
  natural-language `agent()` prompt body (outcome-first framing, grounding, and
  verification for the GPT-5.5 Codex family), keeping `schema` as the owner of
  output shape and `effort` as the owner of reasoning depth.
- `references/example-workflows/`: three runnable, non-review example workflows on
  the generic host API — `research-fan-out` (fan-out-and-synthesize),
  `migrate-pipeline` (discover→transform→verify, using `includeDiff` so a
  non-review path exercises change evidence), and `judge-panel`
  (generate→judge→decide). A test runs the static validator over each so a broken
  example fails `npm test`.
- A failed agent's error now carries a `[codex thread <id>]` correlation id for
  tracing the failure to its Codex app-server thread in run logs.

### Changed

- Renamed the `workspaceContext` diff-evidence concept from "review evidence" to
  the general "change evidence" (`buildChangeEvidenceContext`,
  `ChangeEvidenceContext`, and the `### Change Evidence` context header). It is a
  general primitive any workflow can consume, not review-only; digest-,
  provenance-, and parse-contract-neutral (an in-flight run resumed across the
  upgrade re-runs agents — correct output, extra spend — same class as git drift).
- Reframed the README and default skill toward "general workflow runtime,
  code-review is one built-in"; the code-review vs task machinery asymmetry is
  documented as intentional, not neglect.
- Review guidance is now explicitly review-only: findings are presented ranked
  by severity, and fixes are never auto-applied off the back of a review.
- Documented the Codex model and config conventions the runtime follows: current
  GPT-5.5 model naming, reasoning-effort naming and the `medium` default, auth
  and default-model inheritance from `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}`, and the isolated
  minimal subagent config.

## [0.4.3]

- Rename the `workspaceContext` concept from "review evidence" to "change
  evidence"; add general (non-review) example workflows and a general-first
  skill identity.

## [0.4.2]

- Live runtime reliability study; non-destructive workflow heartbeat for long or
  stuck runs; structured terminal-failure result record.

## [0.4.0]

- P4 hybrid orchestration: the main Codex context plans and synthesizes while
  delegating fan-out phases to the local CLI runtime.

## [0.3.4]

- Resume/cache and worktree-isolation contracts for the local workflow runtime.

## [0.3.2]

- Progress visual routing for native orchestration snapshots.

## [0.3.1]

- Split the packaged skill commands into `ultracode-for-codex` and
  `ultracode-for-codex-cli`.

## [0.3.0]

- Background execution controls: `status`, `wait`, `logs`, `result`, `cancel`,
  `jobs`, and `archive` for local background workflow jobs.

## [0.2.6]

- Dynamic phase planning for the workflow runtime.
